# Need to be done(good features in my opinion)

- Error handling. I need to investigate how errors should be handled in Nest.js (message, status, etc.). Where it should be handled(controller? service? 🤔)
- I don't feel good with build-in fetch. Axios? TanStackQuery? Axios+TanStackQuery?
- Internalization. Next.js build-in internalization or i18?
- AddTrainModal & EditTrainModal refactor.
- Refresh token. PLS!

# Need to be fixed

- AppBar update after logging out. Right now it still shows the previous user name and SignOut button, it's not good 🤦🏻‍♂️
- Safari! 😡 Dude what's wrong with you?! Are you a new Internet Explorer or what? WTF bro?! 🤬
- Need to separate builds. We don't need to deploy client and server at the same time when we made changes on the client or server only.
