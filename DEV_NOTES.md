# Need to be done

- Error handling. Need to investigate how errors should be handled in Nest.js (message, status, etc.). Where it should be handled(controller? service? 🤔)
- I don't feel good with build in fetch. Axios? TanStackQuery? Axios+TanStackQuery?

# Need ti be fixed

- AppBar update after log out. Right now it still shows previous user name and SignOut button, it's not good 🤦🏻‍♂️
